A discussion board indicates that harnessing a browser is a software design methodology of bot software; for example, loading a website into a browser component, logging on, navigating, finding a like button and pressing it, and then logging off. The technique is referred to as “browser manipulation” (https://www.blackhatworld.com/seo/get-build-your-own-bots-for-facebook-pinterest-twitter-and-more-free-open-source.504072/).
